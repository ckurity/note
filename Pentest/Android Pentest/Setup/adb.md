```

The error message you're seeing indicates a version mismatch between the adb server and client. The adb server is running version 41, while your adb client is version 39. To resolve this issue, you should update your adb client to match the server version.

Here are a few steps you can take to update adb:

1. Update Android SDK Platform-Tools:
Ensure you have the latest version of the Android SDK Platform-Tools, which includes adb. You can download the latest version from the official Android developer website.

2. Replace the Old adb Binary:
After downloading the latest version of Platform-Tools, extract the contents of the zip file. Locate the adb binary in the extracted folder, and replace the old adb binary with the new one in your system.

3. Check PATH Environment Variable:
Make sure that the folder containing the updated adb binary is in your system's PATH. This ensures that when you run adb from the command line, it picks up the correct version.

After completing these steps, you should be able to run adb devices -l without encountering the version mismatch error. If you still face issues, make sure to restart the adb server by running:
