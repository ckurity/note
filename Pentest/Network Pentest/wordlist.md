### Small to Big
```
/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt
/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt # default in feroxbuster
/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

I hate this question because there is no context. There is a reason that there are different wordlists. Blindly using a tool is going to get you mediocre results. My process is to use enumeration to determine what wordlists to use. Seclist does a good job dividing up wordlists on their purpose. If I have no clue, yeah I’ll do gobuster with a default list. However, if I learned it is a windows box, I’ll use an all lowercase list. If the page supports cgi, there’s a word list for that directory. There are so many specialties I don’t agree with having one list (or the list is too large to run quickly). You HAVE to combine your enumerated information with your next steps. Take what you learned from the other steps to feed the web page busting.

I use 3 sometimes 4 wordlists, redundant yes but idk that’s what just works for me.

common.txt (from dirb) Medium-2.3.... (from dirbuster) Raft medium directory & raft medium text (seclist) If I still don’t have anything I just use big.txt from seclist.

Or there is an off chance you have the same issue as me, I have a lot of packet loss issues and it’s only with offsec’s services (PWK, PG and their exam..) so my web enumeration never finds anything(hence my redundancy enums), but with HTB or THM or VHL they just work.

You could maybe try getting a commercial vpn or set up a VPS and you’d have a better connection to their servers and let you enumerate properly.
