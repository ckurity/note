# DCSync Attack

> A DCSync attack is where an adversary impersonates a Domain Controller (DC) and requests replication changes from a specific DC. The DC in turn returns replication data to the adversary, which includes account hashes.

### [DCSync attack with secretsdump.py](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/07/18/htb-sauna.html)
> My preferred way to do a DCSync attack is using secretsdump.py, which allows me to run DCSync attack from my Kali box, provided I can talk to the DC on TCP 445 and 135 and a high RPC port. This avoids fighting with AV, though it does create network traffic.
