-------------------------------------------

## Use this
```sh
mkdir bloodhound-python && cd $_
```

The `$_` in the second command represents the last argument of the previous command, which is the directory name you just created. 
So, this will create the "bloodhound-python" directory and then change into it, without explicitly repeating the directory name.

## Equivalent to
```sh
mkdir bloodhound-python; cd bloodhound-python
mkdir bloodhound-python && cd bloodhound-python
```

; is used as a command separator. It allows you to execute multiple commands on a single line. When you use a semicolon, the commands are executed sequentially, regardless of whether the previous command succeeded or failed.

&& operator executes the second command only if the first one succeeds.
