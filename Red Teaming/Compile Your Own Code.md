I prefer to compile tools I use in client environments myself. It may be a bit paranoia, as BloodHound maintains a reliable GitHub with clean builds of their tools. Nonetheless, I think it is a healthy attitude to have a natural distrust of anything executable. In the end, I am responsible for what I do in my client’s environment, and double caution is not a luxury in that regard.
