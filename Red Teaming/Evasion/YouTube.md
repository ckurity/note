Presenter: Will Burgess

Will Burgess is a security consultant with experience across both defensive and offensive cyber security. Will previously worked as a Threat Hunter within MWR's Countercept Division and specialised in detecting advanced malware across enterprises. As part of his role, Will researched attack techniques used by a wide range of malware families (including popular commercial tools such as Cobalt Strike), developed new ways of catching attackers, and presented this research at different conferences. Most recently, Will has been involved in red team engagements, putting his extensive knowledge of detection to bypass and hide from existing Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools and AV solutions. Will's research interests include advanced attack detection, Windows internals, and finding new techniques for post exploitation in Windows environments.
